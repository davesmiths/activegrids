# ActiveGrids

**A way to create pixel based grids yet make them responsive and fluid**

The ActiveGrids default is to work to a grid of 60px min-width columns and dynamically add classes to .ags elements 
dependent on their width, as the page loads. With your favourite JS library bind ActiveGrids to the window 
resize event and layouts will respond to browser resizing.

**Status**: Not ready, an IE issue to be fixed. Otherwise works.

See index.html for a demo/testing page of sorts.

... documentation to come and a better demo page or two
