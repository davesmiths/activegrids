# ActiveGrids

**A way to do container queries â€” create pixel based grids yet make them responsive and fluid**

Demo

The ActiveGrids default is to work to a grid of 60px min-width columns and dynamically add classes to .ags elements
dependent on their width, as the page loads. With your favourite JS library bind ActiveGrids to the window
resize event and layouts will respond to browser resizing.

See index.html for a demo/testing page of sorts.
