# ActiveGrids

ActiveGrids makes responsive fluid layouts based on pixel width grids easy

The ActiveGrids default is to work to a 60px min-width grid and dynamically add classes to .ags elements 
dependent on their width, as the page loads. With your favourite JS library bind ActiveGrids to the window 
resize event and layouts will respond to browser resizing.

Status: Not ready, need to fix an IE issue. Otherwise works.

See index.html for a demo/testing page of sorts.
